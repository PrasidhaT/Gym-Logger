# Gym Logger

Gym Logger is an app I made for my CS 275 Mobile App Development class at UVM.
The app helps track your progress as you lift with a UITableView that shows
your various lifts / exercises, the day it's worked (Example: Chest day),
and the current weight the user lifts. The user can go into a UIStackView
with the details of each lifts including PR and sets & reps.

## Installation

There isn't any additional things needed to install the project. Just download and run.
