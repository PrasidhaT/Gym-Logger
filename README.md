# Gym Logger

Gym Logger is an app I made for my CS 275 Mobile App Development class at UVM.
The app helps track your progress as you lift with a UITableView that shows
your various lifts / exercises, the day it's worked (Example: Chest day),
and the current weight the user lifts. The user can go into a UIStackView
with the details of each lifts including sets & reps.

I did include the functionality to load data to the store from online, I have the CSV in github and loaded it by using the url to the github file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrasidhaT/Gym-Logger/main/csvToLoadData.csv)
